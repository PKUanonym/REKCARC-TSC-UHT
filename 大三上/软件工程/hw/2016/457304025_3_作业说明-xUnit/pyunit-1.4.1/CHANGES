CHANGE LOG FOR PYUNIT
=====================

---------------------------

- corrected version number in distutils 'setup.py'
- fixed an incorrect code example in cookbook document
- fixed bug when running 'unittest.py' from the command line in order
  to execute tests in other modules (thanks to Gary Todd)

Changes from 1.3.1 to 1.4.0
---------------------------

- main() runs all tests in the module __main__ by default
- New code allows all test case in a given module to be located and
  instantiated
- Simplified command line syntax
- Made TextTestRunner configurable with verbose and quiet options, and
  consequently removed obsoleted JUnitTextTestRunner
- Test instantiation code now localised in a replaceable TestLoader class
- 'setup.py' contributed by Bill Bumgarner
- TestResult.addSuccess() method added (thanks to Frederic Corne)
- Stop overridden test methods being run twice (thanks to Brian Zimmer
  and Maas-Marten Zeeman)
- Don't expand GUI's progress bar vertically when resizing (Fred Drake)
- Updated documentation

Changes from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1
---------------------------

  exceptions (thanks to Jim Fulton)

Changes from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0
---------------------------

* Clearer and more verbose text output format
* Tests run in text mode can now be interrupted using ctrl-c
* New FunctionTestCase class provides support for wrapping legacy test
  functions into PyUnit test case instances
* Code is now compatible with JPython (new example: examples/withjpython.py)
* Support for short descriptions of tests, taken from __doc__ strings
  by default
* Updated and expanded documentation
* Tested with Python 2
* Changed module reloading mechanism in GUI test runner to fix a problem
  with Python 2 on Win32 reported by Henrik Weber (bug 125463)

Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.1.0

  Butler)
