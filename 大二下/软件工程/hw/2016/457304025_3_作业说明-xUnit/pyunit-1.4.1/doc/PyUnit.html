    <h2><a name="OVERVIEW">Overview</a></h2>

    <p>
      The Python unit testing framework, dubbed 'PyUnit' by convention, is
      a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> language version of
      <a href="http://members.pingnet.ch/gamma/junit.htm">JUnit</a>, by
      smart cookies Kent Beck and Erich Gamma. JUnit is, in turn, a Java
      version of Kent's Smalltalk testing framework. Each is the de facto
      standard unit testing framework for its respective language.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document explains the Python-specific aspects of the design and
      usage of PyUnit; for background information on the basic design of the
      framework the reader is referred to Kent's original paper,
      <a href="http://www.XProgramming.com/testfram.htm">"Simple Smalltalk
        Testing: With Patterns"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PyUnit forms a part of the Python Standard Library as of Python 
      <a href="http://www.python.org/2.1">version 2.1</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following information assumes knowledge of
      <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, a language so
      easy that even I managed to learn it, and so addictive that I can't stop.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="SYSREQ">System requirements</a></h2>

    <p>
      PyUnit is designed to work with any standard Python, version 1.5.2 and
      higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      PyUnit has been tested by the author on Linux (Redhat 6.0 and 6.1,
      Debian Potato) with Python 1.5.2, 2.0 and 2.1. It is also known to work
      on other Python platforms, including Windows and Mac. If any platform or
      Python version issues cause you trouble, please let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
      For details of using PyUnit with JPython and Jython, please refer to the section
      <a href="#JPYTHON">'Using PyUnit with JPython and Jython'</a>.
    </p>


    <h2><a name="USING">Using PyUnit to write your own tests</a></h2>

    <h4><a name="INSTALL">Installation</a></h4>

    <p>
      The classes needed to write tests are to be found in the 'unittest'
      module. This module is part of the standard Python library for Python 2.1
      and later. If you are using an older Python version, you should
      obtain the module from the separate PyUnit distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be able to use the module from your own code, simply ensure
      that the directory containing the file 'unittest.py' is in your Python
      search path. You can do this by setting the '$PYTHONPATH' environment
      variable, or by placing the file in a directory in your current Python
      search path, such as <code>/usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages</code>
      on Redhat Linux machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you will have to do this before you can run the examples
      that are provided with PyUnit unless you copy 'unittest.py' into the
      examples directory.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="CASEINTRO">An introduction to TestCases</a></h4>
      
    <p>
      The basic building blocks of unit testing are 'test cases' -- single
      scenarios that must be set up and checked for correctness. In PyUnit,
      test cases are represented by the <code>TestCase</code> class in the
      <code>unittest</code> module. To make your own test cases you must
      write subclasses of <code>TestCase</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instance of a <code>TestCase</code> class is an object that can
      completely run a single test method, together with optional set-up
      and tidy-up code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testing code of a <code>TestCase</code> instance should be
      entirely self contained, such that it can be run either in isolation
      or in arbitrary combination with any number of other test cases.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="SIMPLECASE">Creating a simple test case</a></h4>
      
    <p>
      The simplest test case subclass will simply override the
      <code>runTest</code> method in order to perform specific testing code:
    </p>
    <pre>
        import unittest

        class DefaultWidgetSizeTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
            def runTest(self):
                widget = Widget("The widget")
                assert widget.size() == (50,50), 'incorrect default size'
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that in order to test something, we just use the built-in 'assert'
      statement of Python. If the assertion fails when the test case runs, an
      <code>AssertionError</code> will be raised, and the testing framework
      will identify the test case as a 'failure'. Other exceptions that do not
      arise from explicit 'assert' checks are identified by the testing
      framework as 'errors'. (See also the section
      <a href="#TESTCONDS">'More about test conditions'</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to run a test case will be described later. For now, note that
      to construct an instance of such a test case, we call its constructor
      without arguments:
    </p>
    <pre>
        testCase = DefaultWidgetSizeTestCase()
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="RESETUP">Re-using set-up code: creating 'fixtures'</a></h4>

    <p>
      Now, such test cases can be numerous, and their set-up can be repetitive.
      In the above case, constructing a 'Widget' in each of 100 Widget
      test case subclasses would mean unsightly duplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, we
      can factor out such set-up code by implementing a hook method called
      <code>setUp</code>, which the testing framework will automatically
      call for us when we run the test:
    </p>
    <pre>
        import unittest

        class SimpleWidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
            def setUp(self):
                self.widget = Widget("The widget")

        class DefaultWidgetSizeTestCase(SimpleWidgetTestCase):
            def runTest(self):
                assert self.widget.size() == (50,50), 'incorrect default size'

        class WidgetResizeTestCase(SimpleWidgetTestCase):
            def runTest(self):
                self.widget.resize(100,150)
                assert self.widget.size() == (100,150), \
                       'wrong size after resize'
    </pre>
    <p>
      If the <code>setUp</code> method raises an exception while the test
      is running, the framework will consider the test to have suffered an
      error, and the <code>runTest</code> method will not be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we can provide a <code>tearDown</code> method that tidies
      up after the <code>runTest</code> method has been run:
    </p>
    <pre>
        import unittest

        class SimpleWidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
            def setUp(self):
                self.widget = Widget("The widget")
            def tearDown(self):
                self.widget.dispose()
                self.widget = None
    </pre>
    <p>
      If <code>setUp</code> succeeded, the <code>tearDown</code> method
      will be run regardless of whether or not <code>runTest</code>
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a working environment for the testing code is
      termed a <em>fixture</em>.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="MANYTESTMETHODS">TestCase classes with several test methods</a></h4>

    <p>
      Often, many small test cases will use the same fixture. In this case,
      we would end up subclassing <code>SimpleWidgetTestCase</code> into
      many small one-method classes such as 
      <code>DefaultWidgetSizeTestCase</code>. This is time-consuming and
      discouraging, so in the same vein as JUnit, PyUnit provides a simpler
      mechanism:
    </p>
    <pre>
        import unittest

        class WidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
            def setUp(self):
                self.widget = Widget("The widget")
            def tearDown(self):
                self.widget.dispose()
                self.widget = None
            def testDefaultSize(self):
                assert self.widget.size() == (50,50), 'incorrect default size'
            def testResize(self):
                self.widget.resize(100,150)
                assert self.widget.size() == (100,150), \
                       'wrong size after resize'
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here we have not provided a <code>runTest</code> method, but have
      instead provided two different test methods. Class instances will now
      each run one of the <code>test</code>  methods, with
      <code>self.widget</code> created and destroyed separately for each
      instance. When creating an instance we must specify the test method it
      is to run. We do this by passing the method name in the constructor:
    </p>
    <pre>
        defaultSizeTestCase = WidgetTestCase("testDefaultSize")
        resizeTestCase = WidgetTestCase("testResize")
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="SUITES">Aggregating test cases into test suites</a></h4>

    <p>
      Test case instances are grouped together according to the features they
      test. PyUnit provides a mechanism for this: the 'test suite', represented
      by the class <code>TestSuite</code> in the <code>unittest</code>
      module:
    </p>
    <pre>
        widgetTestSuite = unittest.TestSuite()
        widgetTestSuite.addTest(WidgetTestCase("testDefaultSize"))
        widgetTestSuite.addTest(WidgetTestCase("testResize"))
    </pre>
    <p>
      For the ease of running tests, as we will see later, it is a good
      idea to provide in each test module a 'callable' object that returns a
      pre-built test suite:
    </p>
    <pre>
       def suite():
           suite = unittest.TestSuite()
           suite.addTest(WidgetTestCase("testDefaultSize"))
           suite.addTest(WidgetTestCase("testResize"))
           return suite
    </pre>
    <p>
      or even:
    </p>
    <pre>
       class WidgetTestSuite(unittest.TestSuite):
           def __init__(self):
               unittest.TestSuite.__init__(self,map(WidgetTestCase,
                                                     ("testDefaultSize",
                                                      "testResize")))
    </pre>
    <p>
      (the latter is admittedly not for the faint-hearted)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it is a common pattern to create a <code>TestCase</code> subclass
      with many similarly named test functions, there is a convenience
      function called <code>makeSuite</code> provided in the
      <code>unittest</code> module that constructs a test suite that
      comprises all of the test cases in a test case class:-
    </p>
    <pre>
       suite = unittest.makeSuite(WidgetTestCase,'test')
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that when using the <code>makeSuite</code> function, the order in
      which the various test cases will be run by the test suite is the order
      determined by sorting the test function names using the <code>cmp</code>
      built-in function.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="SUITESUITES">Nesting test suites</a></h4>

    <p>
      Often it is desirable to group suites of test cases together, so as to
      run tests for the whole system at once. This is easy, since
      <code>TestSuite</code>s can be added to a <code>TestSuite</code> just
      as <code>TestCase</code>s can be added to a <code>TestSuite</code>:-
    </p>
    <pre>
       suite1 = module1.TheTestSuite()
       suite2 = module2.TheTestSuite()
       alltests = unittest.TestSuite((suite1, suite2))
    </pre>
    <p>
      An example of nesting test suites can be found in the file
      '<code>alltests.py</code>', in the '<code>examples</code>' subdirectory
      of the distribution package.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="WHERE">Where to place testing code</a></h4>

    <p>
      You can place the definitions of test cases and test suites in the
      same modules as the code they are to test (e.g. 'widget.py'), but
      there are several advantages to placing the test code in a
      separate module, such as 'widgettests.py':
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The test module can be run standalone from the command line
      <li>The test code can more easily be separated from shipped code
      <li>There is less temptation to change test code to fit the code it tests
        without a good reason
      <li>Test code should be modified much less frequently than the code
        it tests
      <li>Tested code can be refactored more easily
      <li>Tests for modules written in C must be in separate modules anyway,
        so why not be consistent?
      <li>If the testing strategy changes, there is no need to change the
        source code
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="RUNNING_INT">Running tests interactively</a></h4>

    <p>
      Of course, the whole point of writing these tests is so that we can
      run them and find out if our software is working. The test framework
      uses 'TestRunner' classes to provide an environment in which your tests
      can execute. The most common TestRunner is <code>TextTestRunner</code>,
      which can run tests and report the results in textual form:
    </p>
    <pre>
        runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
        runner.run(widgetTestSuite)
    </pre>
    <p>
      By default, <code>TextTestRunner</code> prints its output to
      <code>sys.stderr</code>, but this can be changed by passing a different
      file-like object to its constructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <code>TextTestRunner</code> like this is an ideal way to run your
      tests interactively from within a Python interpreter session.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="RUNNING_CMD">Running tests from the command line</a></h4>

    <p>
      The <code>unittest</code> module contains a function called <code>main</code>,
      which can be used to easily turn a test module into a script that will
      run the tests it contains. The <code>main</code> function uses the
      <code>unittest.TestLoader</code> class to automatically find and load
      test cases within the current module.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, if you name your test methods using the <code>test*</code>
      convention described earlier, you can place the following code at
      the bottom of your test module:
    </p>
    <pre>
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            unittest.main()
    </pre>
    <p>
      Then, when you execute your test module from the command line, all of
      the tests contained therein will be run. Run the module with the '-h'
      option in order to see the options available.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run arbitrary tests from the command-line, you can run the
      <code>unittest</code> module as a script, giving it the name of an
      test case or test suite:
    </p>
    <pre>
        % python unittest.py widgettests.WidgetTestSuite
    </pre>
    <p>
      or
    </p>
    <pre>
        % python unittest.py widgettests.makeWidgetTestSuite
    </pre>
    <p>
      You may also specify particular tests on the command-line. To run the
      <code>TestCase</code> subclass '<code>ListTestCase</code>' in the
      module 'listtests' (see the 'examples' subdirectory of the distribution
      package) you can execute the command:
    </p>
    <pre>
        % python unittest.py listtests.ListTestCase.testAppend
    </pre>
    <p>
      where 'testAppend' is the name of the test method that is to be run
      by the test case instance. To create and run <code>ListTestCase</code>
      instances for all the 'test*' methods in that class, you can run:
    </p>
    <pre>
        % python unittest.py listtests.ListTestCase
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="GUI">The GUI test runner</a></h4>

    <p>
      There is a graphical front end that you can use in order to run your
      tests. It is written using <code>Tkinter</code>, the windowing toolkit
      shipped with Python on most platforms. It looks similar to the JUnit
      GUI.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the GUI test runner, simply run:
    </p>
    <pre>
        % python unittestgui.py
    </pre>
    or
    <pre>
        % python unittestgui.py widgettests.WidgetTestSuite
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that here, again, the name entered for the test to be run should
      be the fully-qualified name of an object which returns a
      <code>TestCase</code> or <code>TestSuite</code> instance. It should not
      be the name of a pre-created test, since every test must be recreated
      each time it is run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the GUI test runner rather than the text test runner
      imposes a time overhead due to all those window updates; on my system,
      it takes an extra seven seconds per thousand tests. Your mileage may
      vary.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="TESTDOCS">Documenting your tests</a></h4>
    <p>
      Usually, when a test is run its name is displayed by the
      <code>TestRunner</code>. This name is derived from the name of the
      test case class, and the name of the test method that the instance has
      been initialised to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you supply a doc-string for a test method, the first line
      of that doc-string will be displayed when the test is run. This provides
      an easy mechanism for documenting your tests:
    </p>
    <pre>
        class WidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
            def testDefaultSize(self):
                """Check that widgets are created with correct default size"""
                assert self.widget.size() == (50,50), 'incorrect default size'
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="TESTCONDS">More about test conditions</a></h4>
    <p>
      I have suggested the use of Python's built-in assertion mechanism for
      checking conditions in test cases rather than a 'home-brewed'
      equivalent; <code>assert</code> is simple, concise and familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note, however, that if tests are run with Python's
      optimisation option turned on (generating '.pyo' bytecode files), the
      <code>assert</code> statements will be skipped, rendering the
      test cases quite useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who tend to work with Python's optimisation option enabled,
      I have included a method <code>assert_</code> in the
      <code>TestCase</code> class. It is functionally equivalent to the
      <code>assert</code> built-in and will not be optimised away, but it is
      less convenient and results in less helpful error messages:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def runTest(self):
            self.assert_(self.widget.size() == (100,100), "size is wrong")
    </pre>
    <p>
      For good measure I have also provided <code>TestCase</code> with
      <code>failIf</code> and <code>failUnless</code> methods:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def runTest(self):
            self.failIf(self.widget.size() <> (100,100))
    </pre>
    <p>
      A test case method can also call <code>fail</code> in order to fail
      immediately:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def runTest(self):
            ...
            if not hasattr(something, "blah"):
                self.fail("blah missing")
                # or just 'self.fail()'
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="TESTEQUAL">Testing for equality</a></h4>
    <p>
      The most common type of assertion is an assertion of equality between
      two values or objects. If the assertion fails, the developer usually
      wants to see what the incorrect value actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>TestCase</code> has a pair of methods called
      <code>assertEqual</code> and <code>assertNotEqual</code> for this purpose
      (with aliases <code>failUnlessEqual</code> and <code>failIfEqual</code>
      for those who prefer):
    </p>
    <pre>
        def testSomething(self):
            self.widget.resize(100,100)
            self.assertEqual(self.widget.size, (100,100))
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="TESTEXCEP">Testing for exceptions</a></h4>
    <p>
      Often a test will wish to check that an exception is raised in a
      certain set of circumstances. If the expected exception is not thrown,
      the test should fail. This is easy to do:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def runTest(self):
            try:
                self.widget.resize(-1,-1)
            except ValueError:
                pass
            else:
                fail("expected a ValueError")
    </pre>
    <p>
      Usually, the source of the expected exception is a callable object;
      for that reason, <code>TestCase</code> has an
      <code>assertRaises</code> method. The first two arguments of the method
      are the expected exception as it would appear in an 'except' clause,
      and the callable object. The remaining arguments are those that should
      be passed to the callable object:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def runTest(self):
            self.assertRaises(ValueError, self.widget.resize, -1, -1)
    </pre>

    <h2><a name="TESTFUNC">Re-using old test code with PyUnit</a></h2>
    <p>
      Some users will find that they have existing test code that they would
      like to run from PyUnit, without converting every old test function to
      a <code>TestCase</code> subclass.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, PyUnit provides a <code>FunctionTestCase</code> class.
      This subclass of <code>TestCase</code> can be used to wrap an existing
      test function. Set-up and tear-down functions can also optionally be
      wrapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the following test function:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def testSomething():
            something = makeSomething()
            assert something.name is not None
            ...
    </pre>
    <p>
      one can create an equivalent test case instance as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
        testcase = unittest.FunctionTestCase(testSomething)
    </pre>
    <p>
      If there are additional set-up and tear-down methods that should be
      called as part of the test case's operation, they can also be provided:
    </p>
    <pre>
        testcase = unittest.FunctionTestCase(testSomething,
                                             setUp=makeSomethingDB,
                                             tearDown=deleteSomethingDB)
    </pre>


    <h2><a name="JPYTHON">Using PyUnit with JPython and Jython</a></h2>
    <p>
      Although PyUnit was written primarily for 'C' Python, it is possible to
      write PyUnit tests using Jython for your Java or Jython software.
      This can be preferable to trying to write JUnit tests using Jython.
      PyUnit also works correctly with Jython's predecessors, JPython 1.0 and
      1.1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Java does not have a TK GUI interface, so PyUnit's
      Tkinter-based GUI will not work with Jython. The text-only interface
      works just fine, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, simply copy the standard C Python library module files
      '<code>traceback.py</code>', '<code>linecache.py</code>',
      '<code>stat.py</code>' and '<code>getopt.py</code>' to a location from
      which they can be imported by
      JPython. You can get these files from any distribution of
      C Python. (These guidelines are based on the standard library of
      C Python 1.5.x, and may not be correct for other Python versions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can write your PyUnit tests exactly as you would with C Python.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="CAVEATS">Caveats</a></h2>
    
    <h4><a name="ASSERT">Assertions</a></h4>

    <p>
      See the caveats in the section <a href="#TESTCONDS">"More about test
        conditions"</a> above.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="MEMORY">Memory use</a></h4>

    <p>
      When exceptions are raised during the running of a test suite, the
      resulting traceback objects are saved so that failure details can be
      formatted and printed at the end of the test run. Apart from simplicity,
      the benefit of this is that a future version of the GUI TestRunner
      will be able to allow post-mortem inspection of local and global
      variable values, which are stored with the traceback.
    </p>
    <p>
      A possible side-effect is that when running test suites with very high
      failure rates, the memory usage of all these saved traceback objects
      could become a problem. Of course, if so many tests are failing, this
      memory overhead is the least of your problems.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="USETERMS">Terms of use</a></h2>

    <p>
      You may freely use, alter and redistribute this software under the same
      liberal terms that apply to Python itself. All I ask is that my name,
      e-mail address and the project URL be retained in the source code and
      accompanying documentation, with a credit for me as the original author.
    </p>
    <p>
      My motive for writing this software was to make a small contribution
      to the improvement of software quality in the world; I didn't bargain
      on getting any cash. (That's not to say that sponsorship would be
      unwelcome.)
    </p>

    <h2><a name="FUTURE">Future plans</a></h2>

    <p>
      One key plan for the future is to integrate the TK GUI with
      the IDLE IDE. Volunteers are welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than that, I have no great plans to extend the functionality of
      the module. I have kept PyUnit as simple as possible (but no simpler,
      hopefully!) because I believe that helper modules for
      such common testing tasks as log file comparison are better written by
      test writers than by myself.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="UPDATES">Updates and community</a></h2>

    <p>
      News, updates and more are available at the <a href="http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/">
        project website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comments, suggestions and bug reports are welcome; simply e-mail me or,
      better still, join the very low-volume
      <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/pyunit-interest">
        mailing list</a> and post your comments there. There are a surprisingly
      large number of people already using PyUnit, and they all have wisdom
      to share.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="ACKS">Acknowledgements</a></h2>

    <p>
      Many thanks to Guido and his disciples for the Python language. In
      tribute, I have written the following <i>haiku</i> (or '<i>pyku</i>', if
      you will):
    </p>
    <blockquote><cite>
        Guido van Rossum<br>
        'Gawky Dutchman' gave birth to<br>
        Beautiful Python
    </cite></blockquote>
    <p>
      I gratefully acknowledge the work of Kent Beck and Erich Gamma for their
      work on JUnit, which made the design of PyUnit a no-brainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks also to Tim Voght; I discovered after I had implemented PyUnit
      that he had also implemented a 'pyunit' module as part of his 'PyWiki'
      WikiWikiWeb clone. He graciously gave me the go-ahead to submit my
      version to the community at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many thanks to those who have written to me with suggestions and
      questions. I've tried to add appropriate credits in the CHANGES file
      in the download package.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particular thanks to J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Marant, who packaged PyUnit
      for Debian.
    </p>
