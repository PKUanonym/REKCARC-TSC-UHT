The files in the various subdirectories are source code from the
book "An Introduction to Parallel Programming" by Peter Pacheco, 
Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

COMPILING
---------
Most of the programs are self-contained and should compile by
themselves provided you make sure that the compiler can find the
appropriate header files (e.g., mpi.h, pthread.h, semaphore.h,
timer.h) and libraries.  Documentation at the beginning of each
program provides a sample command line for compilation on a typical
Linux or MacOS X system.

RUNNING
-------
The exact syntax for starting the programs may be system dependent.
See your local expert for details.  Any input needed by the program
can be determined from comments at the beginning of the source
file.

I/O
---
All of the longer applications only use process/thread 0 for I/O.
However, some short test programs (e.g., hello, world) print data
from processes or threads other than 0.  Also in many of the programs,
if a DEBUG macro is defined, the program may print data from more
than one process/thread.

DISCLAIMER
----------
These programs are not production quality.  Their main purpose is
to help the reader explore parallel programming.  They should be
easy to modify for a specific application and you are welcome to
do so.  If you have suggestions or discover any bugs it would be
greatly appreciated if you could let us know by sending email to
peter at usfca dot edu
